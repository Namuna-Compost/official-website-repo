            <h2>Why we are</h2>
            <p>
              Nepal is investing a huge share of its agriculture sector investment in the purchase of mineral fertilizers every year. Somehow if we could reduce its import then we can significantly decrease the production cost at farm level and reduce dependability on imports. Moreover, numerous examples of negative consequences of chemical and mineral fertilizers are being observed throughout the globe. Now, developed countries are emphasizing on alternatives of chemical fertilizers like compost, vermin-compost and other biofertilizers incorporation as soil nutrient management strategies.
