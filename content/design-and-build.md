# Facility
Namuna compost manufacturing facility is located at .......address.............. It's
factory layout is situated within the premises of ...............multipurpose agriculture
farmwith an area of ..................Bigha. It has a concrete building for office works
and staffs quarter.

# Process
## 1. Raw materials
In order to produce compost of purest organic form the raw materials are
mostly obtained from the dairy farm itself. Major constituents of raw materials
for making compost are on farm produced cow/buffalo dung, horticultural
waste, saw dust, oilseed cakes and biofertilizers.
## 2. Compost pile
All the raw materials collected from organic origin are shredded and mixed up
initially. The mixture is piled up in rows and allowed to compost under
concrete base in order to manage leaching. Regular monitoring on moisture
content, oxygen content, pH and temperature is performed and recorded for
tracking down the quality of the compost.
## 3. Plant orperation
#### Compost turner
Decomposed compost obtained from the piles are further refined by placing
into the facility where rotating turners continuously turns and mixes the
compost evenly. Here further decomposition occurs.
#### Screening
Then this mixture after completion of turning process is fed into the screening
machines where fine particles are sieved and passed automatically for
granulation
#### Granulation
Sieved particles are fed into disc granulators where moistened particles are
granulated with the desired size.
#### Dryer
The granulated compost are then dried in rotating dryer for controlling the
moisture content of the granules.
#### Cooling
The dried granules are then cooled in the conveyer and transported to
screening section
#### Screening
The dried and cooled granules are passed through sieves for uniformity of the
granule sizes.
#### Packaging
The sieved granules are packed in different packages and stored in the store
house before transporting it to the market.
## 4. Quality control
Lab analysis of each batch is performed in order to monitor the quality of our
compost.
## 5. Packaging and marketing
Once the lab reports are received the production and packaging processes
are performed. Products are packaged into different packets and sealed and
stored in the store room before its dispatch to market.
