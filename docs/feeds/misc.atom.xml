&lt;p&gt;Namuna compost manufacturing facility is located at .......address.............. It's
factory layout is situated within the premises of ...............multipurpose agriculture
farmwith an area of ..................Bigha. It has a concrete building for office works
and staffs quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Process&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Raw materials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to produce compost of purest organic form the raw materials are
mostly obtained from the dairy farm itself. Major constituents of raw materials
for making compost are on farm produced cow/buffalo dung, horticultural
waste, saw dust, oilseed cakes and biofertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Compost pile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the raw materials collected from organic origin are shredded and mixed up
initially. The mixture is piled up in rows and allowed to compost under
concrete base in order to manage leaching. Regular monitoring on moisture
content, oxygen content, pH and temperature is performed and recorded for
tracking down the quality of the compost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Plant orperation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Compost turner&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decomposed compost obtained from the piles are further refined by placing
into the facility where rotating turners continuously turns and mixes the
compost evenly. Here further decomposition occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Screening&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this mixture after completion of turning process is fed into the screening
machines where fine particles are sieved and passed automatically for
granulation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Granulation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sieved particles are fed into disc granulators where moistened particles are
granulated with the desired size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dryer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The granulated compost are then dried in rotating dryer for controlling the
moisture content of the granules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cooling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dried granules are then cooled in the conveyer and transported to
screening section&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Screening&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dried and cooled granules are passed through sieves for uniformity of the
granule sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Packaging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sieved granules are packed in different packages and stored in the store
house before transporting it to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Quality control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab analysis of each batch is performed in order to monitor the quality of our
compost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Packaging and marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the lab reports are received the production and packaging processes
are performed. Products are packaged into different packets and sealed and
stored in the store room before its dispatch to market.&lt;/p&gt;

manner for longer duration which will enable plants to absorb nutrients during their
vegetative growth period. Recommended crops are cereals, vegetables, fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Dust Compost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namuna dust products are designed for faster release of nutrients for crops at field.
It instantly provides crops with necessary macro and micro nutrients and helps
plants to recover from nutrient deficit shocks during their growing period.&lt;/p&gt;
